### Delivery & Ride Hailing Classifier
Applying Natural Language Processing to uberEATS and uber subreddits, my group built classifier models using Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbours and Logistic Regression. We chose Naive Bayes model as our best model as it has the highest accuracy score of 0.775. Through our app, we then applied this model to Grab reviews on Google Play Store to classify between delivery reviews and ride hailing reviews. Our app is able to classify the reviews in a fast and accurate manner.

### HDB Price Predictor
While choosing a set of features that can affect the resale price of a HDB flat, my group built a price predictor model using linear regression. We also refined our model using regularisation methods like Ridge and Lasso to get a better R2 score of 0.87. Applying our model to our app, users can select a set of features and predict the price of a resale flat. For example, a user can set the flat type to be a 4-room flat and the town to be Queenstown and predict the resale price. With our highly accurate model, sellers can avoid selling their flat at a price that is too low or too high.
