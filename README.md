### Work Experience
Geniebook / Teaching Executive (Secondary Math department)                     DEC 2021 - JAN 2024
On GenieAsk, I answered students’ Math and AMath questions and planned Post Exam activities for students to de-stress and enjoy. On GenieSmart, I populated Math questions following the current SEAB syllabus closely to ensure students’ learning objectives are achieved. On GenieClass, I planned and delivered interactive one-hour lessons for Sec 2, Sec 3EMath, Sec 3AMath and Sec 4EMath.
Private Tutor / Math & AMath                                                                         MAR 2020 - DEC 2021
I planned and provided one-to-one tutoring for seven students in Pri 5 to Sec 4. I tailored weekly lessons and formulated study strategies to suit the different learning styles of each individual student. Student Alman improved his EMath from C5 in MYE to B3 in O Level. Student Syisy improved his Math from D in MYE to B in N(T) Level. Student Ryan improved his Math from B4 in S3 to A2 in N(A) Level.
